# TanuKit
TanuKit is design-centric framework meant to be not only eye-candy, but usable.

# Bulma as an upstream
TanuKit is based on Bulma for simplicity and compatibility for TanukiHQ and TanukiWorks projects.
As a result, TanuKit may not use the most up to date version of Bulma and will only perform a pull from upstream when a major change is made on the upstream branch.
